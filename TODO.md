# Version 1.1 Roadmap

## Most Important

* ~~Update the way create object. Make sure it calls Class::create().~~

* ~~Use PaginatedList for AJAX load more.~~

* Improve events filter. Use SearchContext for front-end event filter. e.g. Model admin search bar.

* Add AJAX support for paginated listing.

* Update event registration process to support most up-to-date User Form module(4.2.3).

## Desirable

* Change recurring events module to have a blacklist so submission relationships aren't cloned.

* Add support for block module.
